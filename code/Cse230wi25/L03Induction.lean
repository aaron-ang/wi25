## Trick 1: Helper Lemmas

### Example `add_comm`

Let's try to prove that `add` is commutative; that is, that the order of arguments does not matter.

If we plunge into trying a direct proof-by-induction, we get stuck at two places.

1. What is the value of `add m zero` ?
2. What is the value of `add m (succ n)` ?

It will be convenient to have **helper lemmas** that tell us that

1. `∀ m, add m zero = m`
2. `∀ n m, add n (succ m) = succ (add n m)`

@@@ -/


theorem add_zero : ∀ (n: Nat), add n zero = n := by
  intros n
  induction n
  case zero => rfl
  case succ => simp [add, *]

theorem add_succ : ∀ (n m), add n (succ m) = succ (add n m) := by
  intros n m
  induction n
  case zero => rfl
  case succ => simp [add, *]

theorem add_comm : ∀ (n m: Nat), add n m = add m n := by
  intros n
  induction n
  case zero => simp [add, add_zero]
  case succ => simp [add, add_succ, *]


end MyNat

### Example `rev_rev`

Lets look at another example where we will need helper lemmas.

**Appending lists**

def app {α : Type} (xs ys: List α) : List α :=
  match xs with
  | [] => ys
  | x::xs' => x :: app xs' ys

example : app [] [3,4,5] = [3,4,5] := rfl

**Reversing lists**

def rev {α : Type} (xs: List α) : List α :=

Now, lets _prove_ that the above was not a fluke:
if you reverse a list *twice* then you get back
the original list.

Yikes. We're stuck again. What helper lemmas could we need?









## Trick 2: Generalizing the Variables

Consider the below variant of `add`.

How is it different than the original?
@@@ -/

open MyNat.Nat

def itadd (n m: MyNat.Nat) : MyNat.Nat :=
  match n with
  | zero => m
  | succ n' => itadd n' (succ m)

  itadd (s z) (s s s s s s s z)
  =>
  itadd (z) (s s s s s s s s z)
  =>
  (s s s s s s s s z)
-/


example : itadd (succ (succ zero)) (succ zero) = succ (succ (succ zero)):= by rfl

/- @@@
Lets try to prove that `itadd` is equivalent to `add`.

add n' (succ m) == succ (add n' m)
@@@ -/

theorem add_succ : ∀ (n m), MyNat.add n (succ m) = succ (MyNat.add n m) := by
  intros n m
  induction n

theorem itadd_eq : ∀ (n m), itadd n m = MyNat.add n m := by
  intros n
  induction n
  . case zero => simp [itadd, MyNat.add]
  . case succ n' ih =>
    simp [MyNat.add, itadd, add_succ, ih]

/- @@@
Ugh! Why does the proof fail???

We are left with the goal

```lean
m n' : MyNat.Nat
ih : itadd n' m = MyNat.add n' m
⊢ itadd n' (succ m) = succ (MyNat.add n' m)
```

**IH is too weak**

In the goal above, the `ih` *only* talks about `itadd n m` but *says nothing*
about `itadd n (succ m)`. In fact, the IH should be true **for all** values of `m`
as we **do not really care** about `m` in this theorem. That is, we want to tell
`lean` that the `ih` should be

```lean
m n' : MyNat.Nat
ih : ∀ m, itadd n' m = MyNat.add n' m
⊢ itadd n' (succ m) = succ (MyNat.add n' m)
```

**Generalizing**
We can do so, by using the `induction n generalizing m` which tells `lean` that

- we are doing induction on `n` and
- we *don't care* about the value of `m`

Now, go and see what the `ih` looks like in the `case succ ...`

This time we can **actually use** the `ih` and so the proof works.
@@@ -/

theorem itadd_eq' : ∀ (n m: MyNat.Nat), itadd n m = MyNat.add n m := by
  intros n m
  induction n generalizing m
  case zero => rfl
  case succ => simp [MyNat.add, MyNat.add_succ, itadd, *]


/- @@@
## Trick 3: Generalizing the Induction Hypothesis

Often, the thing you want to prove is not "inductive" by itself. Meaning, that
you want to prove a goal `∀n. P(n)` but in fact you need to prove something stronger
like `∀n. P(n) /\ Q(n)` or even `∀n m, Q(n, m)` which then implies your goal.



### Example: Tail-Recursive `sum`

```
sum 3
=>
3 + sum 2
=>
3 + 2 + sum 1
=>
3 + 2 + 1 + sum 0
=>
3 + 2 + 1 + 0
```

@@@ -/

def sum (n : Nat) : Nat :=

  | 0 => 0
  | n' + 1 => n + sum n'

def loop (n res : Nat) : Nat :=

  | 0      => res
  | n' + 1 => loop n' (res + n)

def sum_tr (n: Nat) := loop n 0

-- loop (n' + 1) 0 == sum (n' + 1)
-- loop a 0  == sum a
-- loop n res  == (sum n) + res

theorem loop_sum : ∀ n res, loop n res = (sum n) + res := by
  intros n res
  induction n generalizing res
  . case zero =>
    simp [loop, sum]
  . case succ n' ih =>
    simp_arith [loop, sum, ih]

theorem sum_eq_sum_tr : ∀ n, sum_tr n = sum n := by
  simp [sum_tr, loop_sum]




/-

fn sum(mut n: Nat) -> Nat {
  let mut res = 0
  while let S n' = n {
    res = res + n;
    n   = n';
  }

}

/- @@@

**Tail-Recursively Summing**

In an _iterative_ language you might write a **loop**
to sum the numbers `n + n-1 + ... + 0` e.g.

```rust
fn sum_tr(mut n: Nat) {
  let mut acc = 0;
  while let succ m = n {
    acc += n;
    n = m
  }
  return acc
}
```

We can write the above with **tail-recursion**

- The recursive call is the "last thing" the function does
- That is, the recursive result is returned without any further computation

**NOTE:** Go and look at `itadd`; is it tail recursive?

@@@-/

-- def sum_tr (n acc : Nat) : Nat :=
--   match n with
--   | 0 => acc

Oops, we are stuck.

We need to know something about `sum_tr n' (n' + 1)` but what?

Can you think of a suitable helper lemma, which would let us directly
prove `sum_eq_sum'`?

```lean
theorem helper: ∀ n acc, sum_tr n acc = sum n + acc := by ...

theorem sum_eq_sum' : ∀ n, sum' n = sum n := by
  intros
  simp_arith [sum', helper]
