# Small Step Semantics

The *big-step* semantics we've seen so far lets us write `⟨ c, s ⟩ ==> t`
to mean that when `c:Com` starts executing from `s:State` it can terminate
execution in `t:State`.

This style of defining what a program *means* was quite useful in that it
let us derive:

1. A way of proving when two *families of* programs are *equivalent*
2. A way of proving assertions about *particular* programs, via Floyd-Hoare logic.

However, the *big-step* semantics do not give us any visibility into
what happens "in the middle", e.g. as the execution marches along from
`s` to `t`.

Sometimes we care about the intermediate **sequence of steps** because

1. maybe the program **does not terminate** and still we want to know that
   nothing "bad" happens during execution, or

2. we want to reason about some low-level operations (e.g. system calls)
   that happen during the execution, and not just the start/final states, or

3. we want to reason about *concurrent* executions where we need to talk about
   the fine-grained interleaved executions of different threads.


## Strategy

So instead of saying `⟨ c, s ⟩ ==> t` we want to model executions as a series

```
c₀ -> c₁ -> c₂ -> c₃ -> ...
```

where

1. Each `cᵢ` is a `Configuration` i.e. a snapshot of the entire system,
2. Each `cᵢ -> cⱼ` is a `SmallStep`, and we can
3. Link the individual step to arbitrarily long sequences of `SmallSteps`.

So our **strategy** has three parts, we have to define a notion of

(1) `Configuration`
(2) `SmallStep`
(3) `SmallSteps`

### IMP

Can you think about how we might do this in `lean` for our IMP language

```
c ::= SKIP | x <~ a | c1 ;; c2 | IF b c1 c2 | WHILE b c
```

### Example

Suppose we have a program like

```
x <~ 10;; y <~ x + 1 ;; z <~ y + 2
```

What do you think the sequence of configurations `c₀ -> ...` might look like?

## An IMP `Configuration`

To define a small-step semantics the `Configuration` must have **all** the information
needed to determine the "next" thing that the program does. This means, a configuration
should include both

1. the **state** that maps each `Vname` to its `Value` (as in the `BigStep` semantics), *and*
2. some representation of the **remaining instructions** to execute next.

We can model the latter in several ways?

- An "instruction memory" that stores the whole program plus
  a program counter indicating current instruction?

- Just store the **remainder** of the program!

We opt for the second option as simpler for IMP:
a `Configuration` is just a *pair* (or *tuple*)
of the **remainder** `Com` and variables' `State`

@@@ -/

abbrev Configuration := (Com × State)

### Example

Lets return to our original example:

@@@ -/

abbrev com₀ : Com := x <~ 10;; (y <~ x + 1 ;; z <~ y + 2)

state `st₀` where all the variables are `0`

## One `SmallStep`

Next, lets try to work out the rules that *define* the `SmallStep` relation.
As usual, lets use the *rules* style formulation which says that *if* the stuff
above the line holds, *then* the stuff below the line holds as well.

**Skip**

```
???
------------------------- [skip]
(Skip, s) -> ???
```

**Assign**

```
???
------------------------- [assign]
(x <~ a, s) -> ???
```

**Sequence**

```
???
------------------------- [seq]
(c1;;c2, s) -> ???
```

**If**

```
bval b s = true
--------------------------------- [if-true]
(IF b THEN c1 ELSE c2, s) -> ???
```

```
bval b s = false
--------------------------------- [if-false]
(IF b THEN c1 ELSE c2, s) -> ???
```

**While**

```
???
-------------------------- [while]
(WHILE b DO c, s) -> ???
```

Next, lets formulate the above as an `inductive SmallStep` relation:

@@@ -/

inductive SmallStep : (Com × State) -> (Com × State) -> Prop where
   | Assign : ∀ {x a s},
                SmallStep (x <~ a, s) (Skip, s [x := aval a s])
   | Seq1   : ∀ {c s},
                SmallStep ((Skip ;; c), s) (c, s)
   | Seq2   : ∀ {c1 c1' c2 s s'},
                SmallStep (c1, s) (c1', s') ->
                SmallStep ((c1 ;; c2) , s) ((c1' ;; c2), s')
   | IfTrue : ∀ {b c1 c2 s},
                bval b s == true ->
                SmallStep (IF b THEN c1 ELSE c2, s) (c1, s)
   | IfFalse : ∀ {b c1 c2 s},
                bval b s == false ->
                SmallStep (IF b THEN c1 ELSE c2, s) (c2, s)
   | While   : ∀ { b c s },
                SmallStep (Com.While b c, s) (Com.If b (c ;; (Com.While b c)) Skip, s)


/- @@@
## Many `SmallSteps`

We can now extend the *single* `SmallStep` relation to handle
arbitrarily many steps, simply by taking its **transitive closure**!

That is, recall the definition of `star r` as taking zero or more `r`-steps

```lean
inductive star {α : Type} (r: α -> α -> Prop) : α -> α -> Prop where
  | refl : ∀ {a : α}, star r a a
  | step : ∀ {x y z : α}, r x y -> star r y z -> star r x z
```

abbrev Steps := star SmallStep

### Example: Skip

Lets show that a `Skip` cannot update the state.

### Example: Assignments

Lets show that an assignment `x <~ a` updates the state as follows:

## `SmallStep` is Deterministic

Let us prove that the `~~>` relation is **deterministic**,
meaning, that each `Configuration` can only step to **at most**
one other `Configuration`.

In other words, if a configuration `cs ~~> cs1` and `cs ~~> cs2`
then `cs1` and `cs2` must be the same.

### `SmallStep` implies `BigStep`

Next, lets try to prove that
if using **many small steps** we have `(c, s) ~~>* (Skip, t)`
then, in a **single big step** we have `⟨ c, s ⟩ ==> t`.

The only way to do so will be an induction on the *sequence of small steps*.

Yikes! We are stuck! We need some sort of *helper lemma* that will tell us
something about what happens after executing a *single* small step!

Uh oh, in the `Seq` case we get stuck because

- we have `⟨ c1, s ⟩ ==> s1`, which implies `(c1, s)  ~~>* (Skip, s1)` (by the IH)
- we have `⟨ c2, s1 ⟩ ==> t`, which implies `(c2, s1) ~~>* (Skip, t)`  (by the IH)

But we need to **join the `SmallStep` sequences** for `c1` and `c2` to get one for `c1;;c2`.

But how? We need some additional lemma, but what should that lemma *say*?
